Please systematically fix the template editor connection issues for the remaining 3 templates (Services, Tourism, and Retail). The Professionals and Restaurant templates have been mostly fixed, but these 3 need the same comprehensive treatment.

SPECIFIC ISSUES TO FIX:

Editor Function Connectivity: Ensure all editor input fields in ServicesEditor.tsx, TourismEditor.tsx, and RetailEditor.tsx properly update their respective demo pages (ServicesDemo.tsx, TourismDemo.tsx, RetailDemo.tsx)
Data Flow Problems: Fix the "undefined is not an object" errors occurring when accessing translation objects (like obj[language]) in the demo components
Configuration Schema Alignment: Ensure all template editors save/load data in the same format as the working Professionals and Restaurant templates
REQUIRED FIXES FOR EACH TEMPLATE:

A. ServicesEditor.tsx & ServicesDemo.tsx:

Fix all input field connections (business name, description, services, contact info)
Ensure proper translation object handling for bilingual content
Verify image upload functionality works
Test real-time preview updates
B. TourismEditor.tsx & TourismDemo.tsx:

Connect tour/activity editing fields to demo display
Fix location and pricing information editing
Ensure photo gallery editing works properly
Verify booking/contact form functionality
C. RetailEditor.tsx & RetailDemo.tsx:

Connect product catalog editing to demo display
Fix inventory and pricing field updates
Ensure shopping features work in preview
Verify store hours and contact editing
TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

State Management: Use the same useState/useEffect patterns as the working Restaurant template
API Integration: Ensure all templates use the same PUT /api/config/default endpoint structure
Error Handling: Add proper null checks for translation objects and nested data
Data Validation: Validate required fields before saving configurations
Real-time Updates: Implement immediate preview updates when editing fields
TESTING CHECKLIST:

For each template, verify:

 All text fields update the preview immediately
 Image uploads replace placeholder images correctly
 Language switching works in both editor and preview
 Save/load configuration preserves all changes
 No console errors when editing any field
 Mobile responsiveness works in preview
 Special characters (áéíóú, ñ) display correctly
PATTERN TO FOLLOW:

Use the working RestaurantsEditor.tsx and RestaurantsDemo.tsx as the reference implementation. Copy the successful patterns for:

Configuration object structure
State update functions
Translation handling
Image management
API calls
PRIORITY ORDER:

Fix Services template first (most commonly used)
Tourism template second (high visibility)
Retail template third (complete the set)
Please implement these fixes systematically, testing each template thoroughly before moving to the next one. The goal is to have all 5 template types working with full editor functionality by completion.
