Create a Node.js project using Express and EJS to build a static website for WebSitioPro, a website-building service for small businesses in Mexico. The site includes a scrollable one-page main site (websitiopro.com) and a separate Pro page (websitiopro.com/pro). Use a vibrant Mexican-inspired color scheme (red #C8102E, green #00A859, white #FFFFFF, optional yellow #FFC107 or blue #007BFF) and Bootstrap 5 (via CDN) for a responsive, mobile-friendly design.
