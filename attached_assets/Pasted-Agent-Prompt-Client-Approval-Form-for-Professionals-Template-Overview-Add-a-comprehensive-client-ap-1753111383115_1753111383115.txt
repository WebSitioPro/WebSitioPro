4. Admin Toggle Controls

5. Data Structure
Store approval data in this format:

  "clientApproval": {
    "isFormEnabled": true,
    "formStatus": "active", // active, completed, disabled
    "clientInfo": {
      "name": "",
      "email": "",

    },
    "sectionApprovals": {
      "hero": { "status": "pending", "approved": false, "comments": "" },
      "about": { "status": "pending", "approved": false, "comments": "" },
      "services": { "status": "pending", "approved": false, "comments": "" },

  }
}
