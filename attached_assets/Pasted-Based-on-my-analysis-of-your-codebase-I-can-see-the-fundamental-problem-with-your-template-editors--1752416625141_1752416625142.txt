Based on my analysis of your codebase, I can see the fundamental problem with your template editors. Here's the detailed report:

The Core Problem
Your template editors are not properly isolated - they're sharing configurations instead of having separate ones for each template type. This causes:

Data Contamination - When you edit one template, it affects others
Homepage Corruption - Templates can accidentally modify your main site
Lost Work - Edits get overwritten by other templates
Specific Issues Found
1. Configuration ID Problems
From the console logs, I can see your homepage loads correctly:

["Loaded saved config:",{"id":1,"name":"WebSitioPro Homepage"...
But your template editors in client/src/templates/*/ are likely defaulting to "default" instead of using unique IDs.

2. Missing URL Parameter Extraction
Your template editors should extract client IDs from URLs like:

/editor/professionals?client=prof-123
/editor/tourism?client=tour-456
But they're probably not doing this properly.

3. Shared Database Records
All templates are hitting the same database configuration instead of having separate ones.

Quick Fix Solutions for the Agent
CRITICAL: DO NOT TOUCH THE MAIN HOMEPAGE OR HOMEPAGE CONFIGURATION

Solution 1: Fix Template Editor URL Handling
Each template editor needs to:

Extract clientId from URL parameters: const clientId = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get('client') || 'demo'
Use that clientId in API calls: /api/config/${clientId}
Never use "default" as fallback
Solution 2: Implement Proper Demo Configurations
Create separate demo configs for each template:

professionals-demo (already exists)
tourism-demo
retail-demo
services-demo
restaurants-demo
Solution 3: Update Template Editor Navigation
Template selector should link to: /editor/tourism?client=tourism-demo

Recommended Agent Instructions
"Fix the template editors to use proper client isolation:

DO NOT MODIFY THE HOMEPAGE OR MAIN SITE CONFIGURATION
Update each template editor to extract clientId from URL parameters
Use unique demo configurations for each template type
Ensure template editors never use 'default' configuration
Test that editing one template doesn't affect others
Verify homepage remains untouched"
Cost-Effective Approach
Instead of rewriting editors line by line, focus on:

Configuration isolation - 1 checkpoint
URL parameter handling - 1 checkpoint
Demo config creation - 1 checkpoint
This should fix all 5 template editors simultaneously rather than fixing each one individually.

The isolation system in server/config-isolation.ts already exists but isn't being used properly by the frontend editors. The fix is to connect the frontend to use this existing system.
