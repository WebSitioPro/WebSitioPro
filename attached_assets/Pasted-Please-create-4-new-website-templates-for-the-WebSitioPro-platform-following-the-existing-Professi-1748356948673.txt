Call-to-action: "Make Reservation" button (when enabled), "View Menu" section

Technical Requirements:

Database Schema Updates: Expand the existing WebsiteConfig schema to include:
Template type field (professionals, restaurant, tourist, retail, services)
Template-specific toggle fields (reservations, bookings, shopping cart)
Template-specific content fields
Template Generator Updates: Enhance server/templateGenerator.ts to:
Generate different HTML/CSS/JS based on template type
Include template-specific sections and functionality
Implement toggleable features (reservations, bookings, etc.)
Editor Interface Updates: Modify client/src/pages/EditorPage.tsx to:
Add template type selection
Show/hide template-specific editing fields
Include toggle controls for optional features
Provide template-specific content editing
Preview Functionality: Each template should:
Generate fully functional static HTML sites
Include mobile-responsive design
Work with the existing chatbot system
Support bilingual content (Spanish/English)
Include WhatsApp integration
Specific Toggle Features to Implement:

Reservations (Restaurant): Enable/disable reservation form and booking system
Tour Bookings (Tourist): Enable/disable tour booking functionality
Shopping Cart (Retail): Enable/disable e-commerce features
Emergency Services (Services): Enable/disable 24/7 emergency contact section
Existing Pattern to Follow:

Study the current Professionals template in templateGenerator.ts
Use the same color system, chatbot integration, and responsive design
Maintain consistency with the existing WebSitioPro branding and structure
Ensure all templates work with the current editor system
File Structure Considerations:

Keep template generation logic in server/templateGenerator.ts
Template selection and editing in client/src/pages/EditorPage.tsx
Schema updates in shared/schema.ts
Maintain backward compatibility with existing Professional templates
Please implement this as a complete system where users can select a template type, configure template-specific features with toggles, and generate fully functional static websites for each business type.
