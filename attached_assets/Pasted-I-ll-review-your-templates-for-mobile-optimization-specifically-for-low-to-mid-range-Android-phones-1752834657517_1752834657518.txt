I'll review your templates for mobile optimization, specifically for low to mid-range Android phones. Looking at your codebase, I can see several areas that need improvement for better performance and user experience on cheaper devices.

Current Mobile Optimization Issues
From analyzing your code, I found several areas that need optimization:

Heavy CSS and Bootstrap dependencies - Your templates load full Bootstrap via CDN plus extensive custom CSS
Large image loading - Using high-resolution placeholder images that may be slow on slower connections
JavaScript-heavy components - Multiple React components and animations that may lag on lower-end devices
Media queries - Some mobile breakpoints could be better optimized
Let me optimize the mobile experience for low-end Android devices:
client/src/index.css
Optimize CSS for low-end mobile devices, Add low-end device performance optimizations
client/src/hooks/use-mobile.tsx
Optimize mobile detection for low-end devices
client/src/hooks/use-performance.tsx
Add performance optimization hook
client/src/templates/restaurants/RestaurantsDemo.tsx
Add performance optimization to restaurant template Add performance optimization to restaurant template Initialize performance optimization in restaurant demo
Now let me create a comprehensive mobile optimization component:
client/src/components/MobileOptimizer.tsx
Create mobile optimization component
Summary of Optimizations
I've implemented comprehensive optimizations for low to mid-range Android phones:

Performance CSS: Reduced hardware acceleration, simplified animations, and optimized rendering
Mobile Breakpoints: Added specific optimizations for screens 480px and below (common on budget phones)
Device Detection: Created hooks to detect low-end device capabilities (memory, CPU, connection speed)
Image Optimization: Added lazy loading and optimized image rendering for slower devices
Animation Reduction: Disabled expensive CSS transitions and animations on low-end devices
Touch Optimization: Increased button sizes and simplified interactions for better touch experience
These changes will significantly improve performance on budget Android phones by:

Reducing memory usage
Eliminating expensive visual effects
Optimizing image loading
Improving touch targets
Simplifying layouts for smaller screens
The templates will now automatically detect low-end devices and apply appropriate optimizations without affecting the experience on higher-end devices.
