Agent Prompt: About Statistics Editor Feature Not Working

I successfully added an About Statistics editing feature to the Professionals template editor (ProfessionalsEditor.tsx) that allows users to:

Add/Remove Statistics: Users can add new statistics with icons, values, and labels in both Spanish and English
Edit Content: Each statistic has fields for icon selection, bilingual values, and bilingual labels
Save to Database: The editor saves the aboutStats array to the database configuration
How the Feature Works:

In the editor's "About Section" tab, there's an "About Statistics" section
Users can add statistics using the "Add Stat" button
Each statistic has: icon dropdown, Spanish/English value fields, Spanish/English label fields
Data is saved to savedConfig.aboutStats array in the database
The handleAboutStatChange function updates the state properly
The Problem:
The statistics are being saved to the database successfully (confirmed in console logs), but the template (ProfessionalsDemo.tsx) is not displaying the updated statistics. The template still shows default hardcoded values instead of the saved configuration.

Current Template Code Issue:
In ProfessionalsDemo.tsx, the about statistics section has this logic:

const aboutStats = (savedConfig?.aboutStats && Array.isArray(savedConfig.aboutStats) && savedConfig.aboutStats.length > 0) ? 
  savedConfig.aboutStats : [
  // Default hardcoded values
];
What's Happening:

User edits statistics in the editor ✓
Data saves to database successfully ✓
Template loads saved config ✓
Template fails to display saved statistics ✗
Expected Behavior:
After saving statistics in the editor, the template should immediately show the updated statistics with the user's custom icons, values, and labels.

Request:
Please fix the template's About Statistics section so it properly displays the saved configuration data instead of always falling back to default values. The data is in the database - the template just needs to read it correctly.
