# WebSitioPro Deployment Guide

## Current Situation
Your WebSitioPro server is running correctly on localhost:5000 but the external URL `https://websitiopro.bluerockchris.replit.dev` isn't accessible from browsers because Replit development environments require deployment for external access.

## What's Working
- Server runs on 0.0.0.0:5000 with proper binding
- Health endpoint returns JSON locally
- Make webhook processes business data correctly
- CORS headers configured for external requests
- All API routes functional

## To Fix Browser Access
**Click the Deploy button in your Replit interface**

This creates a live external URL that browsers and Make.com can access.

## After Deployment
Your endpoints will be accessible at:
- `https://websitiopro.bluerockchris.replit.dev/health`
- `https://websitiopro.bluerockchris.replit.dev/api/make/auto-create`

## Make.com Integration Ready
The webhook system is complete:
- Validates business data (phone numbers, Facebook metrics)
- Generates professional Mexican-themed templates
- Returns proper success/error responses
- Ready for 30 websites per day automation

**Status: Ready for deployment - click Deploy to resolve browser access**
