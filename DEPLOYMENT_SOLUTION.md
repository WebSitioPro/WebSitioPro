# WebSitioPro External URL Access Solution

## Current Status
- Server running correctly on 0.0.0.0:5000
- Health endpoint returning proper JSON locally
- Make webhook fully functional and tested
- CORS headers configured for external access

## The Issue
Replit development servers are not automatically accessible from external browsers. The URL `https://websitiopro.bluerockchris.replit.dev` requires deployment to be accessible from Safari or Make.com.

## Solution: Deploy the Project

### Steps to Deploy:
1. Click the **Deploy** button in the Replit interface
2. Select **Autoscale Deployment**
3. The deployment will create a stable external URL

### Post-Deployment URLs:
- Health Check: `https://websitiopro.bluerockchris.replit.dev/health`
- Make Webhook: `https://websitiopro.bluerockchris.replit.dev/api/make/auto-create`
- Main Site: `https://websitiopro.bluerockchris.replit.dev`

### Make.com Integration Ready:
Once deployed, the webhook endpoint will reliably handle:
- Business data validation
- Template generation
- Automation for 30 websites per day

The server configuration is correct - deployment will resolve the browser accessibility issue while maintaining all functionality.
