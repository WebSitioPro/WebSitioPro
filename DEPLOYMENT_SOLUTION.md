# WebSitioPro External URL Access Solution

## Issue Confirmed
External URL accessibility from browsers requires Replit deployment. Development servers run internally but aren't exposed to external browsers.

**Test Results:**
- Local server: ✅ Working (localhost:5000)
- External URL: ❌ Requires deployment
- All endpoints: Ready for deployment

## Server Status
- Running on 0.0.0.0:5000 with proper binding
- CORS headers configured for external access
- Make webhook tested and functional locally
- Health endpoint returning proper JSON

## Deployment Solution

### To Make URL Accessible:
1. Click **Deploy** button in Replit interface
2. Select deployment type (Autoscale recommended)
3. External URL becomes browser-accessible

### Post-Deployment Endpoints:
```
Health Check: /health
Make Webhook: /api/make/auto-create
Agent API: /api/agent/create-template
Template Generator: /api/templates
```

### Make.com Integration Ready
The webhook system is complete and tested:
- Validates business data (phone, Facebook likes, etc.)
- Generates professional templates
- Returns proper success/error responses
- Ready for 30 websites/day automation

**Current Status: Ready for deployment**
