# Image Upload Guide for WebSitioPro

## How to Upload Images Correctly

### Using ImgBB (Recommended)

1. Go to https://imgbb.com/
2. Click "Upload" or drag your image
3. Wait for upload to complete
4. **IMPORTANT**: Copy the "Direct link" (not the "Image link")
   - ✅ Correct format: `https://i.ibb.co/xxxxxxx/image.jpg`
   - ❌ Wrong format: `https://ibb.co/xxxxxxx` (this is a page link)

### Alternative Options

1. **Unsplash** (for stock photos):
   - Go to unsplash.com
   - Find an image
   - Right-click and "Copy image address"
   - Format: `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-xxxxx`

2. **Pexels** (for stock photos):
   - Similar to Unsplash
   - Right-click image and copy address

### URLs That DON'T Work
- ❌ Google Photos: `https://photos.google.com/photo/...`
- ❌ ImgBB page links: `https://ibb.co/xxxxx`
- ❌ Social media direct links (Facebook, Instagram, etc.)

### Testing Your Image URL
Before saving in the editor:
1. Open a new browser tab
2. Paste the URL
3. If you see ONLY the image (no website around it), it's correct
4. If you see a webpage with the image, it's wrong

## Troubleshooting
If your image doesn't show:
1. Check if the URL is a direct image link
2. Make sure the URL starts with `https://`
3. Try opening the URL in a new tab to verify it works
